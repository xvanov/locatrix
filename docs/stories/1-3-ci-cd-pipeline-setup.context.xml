  <tests>
    <standards>
      The CI/CD pipeline must run pytest tests from src/tests/unit/ and src/tests/integration/ directories before deployment. Tests use pytest framework with configuration from pytest.ini. Test structure follows patterns established in Story 1.2: unit tests for individual functions/classes, integration tests for API endpoints and services. Pipeline testing includes workflow syntax validation, build job completion, test job execution, deployment job execution, status check reporting, and deployment trigger validation.
